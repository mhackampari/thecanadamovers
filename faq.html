                                The busiest times for moving companies are during the summer months, taking place roughly between May 15 - September 15. Near the ends of these months, the volume of shipments is extremely heavy—this tends to be the case for all professional relocation and moving companies.
                                It’s important to take all factors into consideration when deciding on the best time for you to move. If you have some flexibility in your schedule, providing the moving company with a five-day window for loading your shipment can be greatly beneficial. This will allow the individuals who schedule your drivers and moving crew greater flexibility when scheduling your move. If possible, try to be flexible with your arrival time frame as well—keep in mind that you most likely are not the only shipment the truck is currently moving. Offering a flexible time frame can make a world of difference, and make your entire process of moving much easier.

                                Try to provide the moving companies with as much notice as possible, especially if you are moving during a busy summer season, as noted above. Six weeks from the actual move date is a great time frame for estimators to come into your home and complete a visual survey of your household goods shipment. It is also a good idea to add even more time to make a decision, in the event that you are obligated by your employer to submit moving estimates for a corporate relocation. Try to decide which mover you will use at least four weeks from your actual load day. Additionally, call the mover to confirm your booking and schedule your packing, loading and delivery dates. This time frame can be shortened if you are moving outside of the peak moving season (September 15 through May 15 are considered “off peak” months, which generally feature less moving traffic).

                                If you are moving to a different state, the charges will be based on the weight of your shipment and mileage—these are referred to as the transportation charges. There are a variety of different moving charges that can potentially appear on your estimate, so be sure to ask your relocation specialist to explain each charge for you. Some additional charges that may appear include packing, crating, valuation or coverage, bulky article charge (for oversized items), and extra labor. Again, please be certain you fully understand these charges so that you can accurately compare the estimates you receive.

                                Tariff provisions require that all moving charges be paid before your shipment is unloaded at the destination. Payments can be made using cash, certified check, or money order. Other payment options, such as a credit card, can be arranged with your professional moving service provider. Discuss these options with the relocation specialist and/or the customer service representative assigned to your shipment. In the event that your employer is paying for the move, the employer may pre-arrange to be billed via invoice. Whatever works best for your situation is great—just be sure to have the details worked out prior to when packing and loading begins –if the method of payment is not established prior to load day, it can cause you problems on delivery day.

Again, your estimator can help you understand how these items are properly serviced. All local moving companies have business relationships with local service providers that handle this type of service, however full service moving companies and national moving companies will also be able to provide all of the moving services you require. Be sure you know who your mover will be using, as you will need to let these people into your home to provide the service.

The moving company will assign a customer service representative as your primary contact, and will be able to track your shipment and provide you with an update on the date that your goods will arrive.Be certain to provide the driver with all of your contact information—the phone number at the new home is only good if there is a person there to take the call. If you can be reached at work, a hotel, a temporary residence, or by email, please let the driver know. If you will be impossible to reach, it is encouraged to make arrangements with a friend or family member to serve as the liaison between you and the driver, and provide the driver with that contact information.
